Day 1 -- 1/14/21 
- Done
    - Set up stuff for Manthan 
        - Node.js, webpack, three, vs code, github (everything)
        - Explained code and current situation 
    - Deleted force functions 
        - Decided on potential minimization rather than force minimization
- What's Left
    - Graphics 
        - Movement controls need to be fixed
        <<<<- Preference to orbit-like controls
        - Maybe see if things can be cleaner
<<<<- Science stuff
        - Research the potential stuff for each of the fundamental forces (not gravity, too weak)
        - Think about what to do for forces without superposition
        - Think about different situations with equal potential (potential wells)
        - Think about if particles are moving in nucleus
            - Maybe this is why people don't do this project? 
    - Recursive Algorithm 
        - Shouldn't be extremely complicated
            - Go via route of minimax sort of (DFS type route)
            - Alpha-Beta pruning and then some other optimization 
    <<<<- Needs to be developed still though
